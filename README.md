## My process

This project really gave me a feel for the prowess of JavaScript and the DOM. I really followed the Udacity 
Development Strategy by working from top to bottom. Our first step was to link the ```app.js``` file to the ```index.html```.
Next we added our section to the HTML (section 4). We also began to build our navigation menu. After building the navigation bar,
we began to add some functionality to the page. To be continued...



### Built with

* HTML5
* Custom CSS Properties 
* JavaScript 

### Continued development

JavaScript is really cool, I would like to experience more with JavaScript in the DOM and create some unique landing pages!
